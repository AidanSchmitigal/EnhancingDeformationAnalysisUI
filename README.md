# EnhancingDeformationAnalysisUI

A comprehensive tool for material scientists and researchers to analyze SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) imagery of materials undergoing deformation. This application combines computer vision techniques with AI-powered models to enhance image quality, detect structural changes, and quantify deformation metrics.

## Key Capabilities

- **Advanced Image Enhancement**: AI-powered denoising optimized for SEM imagery
- **Real-time Crack Detection**: Automated identification of cracks and structural defects
- **Deformation Quantification**: Track and measure material changes over time
- **Multi-format Analysis Export**: Generate reports in CSV for further analysis
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently process large datasets with CLI support
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilize CUDA for improved performance on supported hardware

## Installation

To clone this repo:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:OSU-Enhancing-Deformation-Analysis/EnhancingDeformationAnalysisUI
```
Don't miss the `--recursive` part of that command to get all required submodules!

If you missed that part, initialize the submodules with:
```bash
git submodule update --init
```

This program uses [tk_r_em](https://github.com/Ivanlh20/tk_r_em)'s models for denoising SEM images at various resolutions and microscopy types.

## Building

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.5 or higher
- OpenCV ~4.0.0 or higher with the OpenCV_DIR environment variable set to the path of the OpenCVConfig.cmake file
- [Tensorflow C API](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) installed on system path (findable by CMake)
- On Windows: CUDA 11 & cuDNN 8.x.x installed to PATH
- On Linux: CUDA 12.x & cuDNN 9.x.x installed to PATH, Zenity for file browsing operations

### Compilation

#### Linux (maybe macOS?)
```bash
cd EnhancingDeformationAnalysisUI && mkdir build
cd build && cmake ..
make -j4  # or however many cores you want to use
```

For CUDA support on Linux:
```bash
export XLA_FLAGS=--xla_gpu_cuda_data_dir=/usr/lib/cuda
```

#### Windows
1. Use the setup script `setup.py` to set up the project and install OpenCV and TensorFlow
2. Make sure to set the environment variables as instructed
3. Open the folder using Visual Studio (assuming Desktop C++ package installed)
4. Select the correct startup item from the dropdown: `EnhancingDeformationAnalysisUI.exe`
5. Use F5 to build and run

## Using the Application

### GUI Mode

Launch the application without any command-line arguments to use the GUI:

1. **Loading Images**: 
   - Click "Select Folder" to choose a directory containing TIFF images
   - Each image set opens in its own tab
   - Supports time-series SEM image sequences

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Crop images to remove unneeded parts (scale bars, timestamps, etc.)
   - Stabilize image sequence to reduce movement and vibration artifacts
   - Remove/filter specific frames with artifacts or focus issues
   - Apply denoising using standard methods (blur) or specialized AI models optimized for:
     - High-resolution SEM (sfr_hrsem)
     - Low-resolution SEM (sfr_lrsem)
     - TEM and STEM variants at different resolutions
   - Detect cracks with adjustable parameters for sensitivity and minimum size

3. **Image Analysis**:
   - View histograms for each image to analyze intensity distributions
   - Compare images visually with synchronized navigation
   - Export analysis data as CSV for further processing
   - Generate statistics on image features, crack properties, and deformation metrics

4. **Export Options**:
   The Image Comparison tab provides comprehensive export functionality:
   
   **Single Frame Export**:
   - Export current frame from original sequence as TIFF
   - Export current frame from processed sequence as TIFF
   
   **Batch Export**:
   - Export all original frames as individual TIFF files
   - Export all processed frames as individual TIFF files
   - Export processed sequence as animated GIF (with configurable playback speed)
   
   **Analysis Data Export**:
   - Export histogram and SNR analysis data as CSV files
   - Export crack width measurements and feature tracking data as CSV
   - Export strain analysis results for quantitative research

5. **Feature Tracking**:
   - Track points manually by selecting features of interest
   - Track automatically using detected cracks or structural features
   - Measure deformation over time with displacement vectors
   - Calculate strain fields between image frames

6. **Strain Analysis**:
   - Generate strain maps to visualize deformation patterns
   - Calculate local and global strain metrics
   - Export strain data for quantitative analysis
   - Compare strain evolution across multiple time points

### Command Line Interface

For batch processing or integration into automated workflows, use the CLI mode:

```bash
./EnhancingDeformationAnalysisUI --folder <path> [--crop <pixels>] [--denoise <blur/sfr_hrsem/...>] [--analyze <output.csv>] [--calculate-widths <widths.csv>] [--output <path>]
```

Options:
- `--folder <path>`: Directory containing TIFF images (required)
- `--crop <pixels>`: Remove specified number of pixels from image bottom
- `--denoise <filter>`: Apply denoising filter (options: blur, sfr_hrsem, sfr_lrsem, etc.)
- `--analyze <output.csv>`: Generate image analysis statistics
- `--calculate-widths <widths.csv>`: Calculate and export crack width measurements
- `--output <path>`: Save processed images to specified directory

## Technical Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture:

- **Core Analysis Engine**: C++ classes for image processing and deformation analysis
- **TensorFlow Integration**: Uses cppflow to interface with TensorFlow for AI model inference
- **UI Layer**: ImGui-based interface for interactive visualization and parameter adjustment
- **Threading Support**: Background processing for responsive UI during heavy computations
- **File I/O**: Support for TIFF formats commonly used in microscopy

## Common Use Cases

### Material Testing Analysis
Process image sequences from material testing experiments to quantify:
- Crack initiation and propagation 
- Strain localization patterns
- Material failure mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Image Loading Failures**: Ensure TIFF files are standard format without compression artifacts
- **GPU Acceleration Issues**: 
  - Verify CUDA and cuDNN versions match requirements
  - On Linux, make sure XLA_FLAGS is set correctly
- **Slow Performance**: 
  - Enable profiling with `UI_PROFILE=ON` in CMake to identify bottlenecks
  - Consider using smaller image subsets for initial analysis
